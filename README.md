# Fotomatic

In this project, I fixed a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. I was provided with specs and a working version of the final product to help guide me in making the necessary adjustments to the broken code. To debug and update the site's CSS, I used the skills and tools acquired from the Codecademy.com courses.

*The project set up is offered by:* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog)

I am now happy to say that the project is complete and the website is fully functional and responsive.
